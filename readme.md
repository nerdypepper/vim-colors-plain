vim-colors-plain is a duotonic color scheme, the two accents
being cyan and pink by default (configurable).

vim-plug does not support installing plugins from sources
that do not allow shallow clones (such as git.peppe.rs), i
would suggesting installing manually by cloning into your
plugin directory or dropping `colors/plain.vim` into one of
the following directories:

 - vim: `.vim/plugin`
 - neovim: `.config/nvim/plugin`
